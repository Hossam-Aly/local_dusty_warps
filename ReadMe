This is a repo for the local dusty warps project, serving papers 1 and 2, and maybe useful for future papers as well?

Here is the folder descriptions:

- data: Any data we want to share. Need to be cautious and avoid sharing entire runs. At the moment it just has tables for the max dust density evolution as used in paper 1

- figures: Will contain all the figures for paper 1. Callum is also welcome to use it to contain figures for paper 2

- scripts: Any script notebooks used for analysis, plotting, and setting up simulations. So far figures.ipynb will contain the exact scripts to produce all figures for paper 1 (Callum can also use it for paper 2 figures, or have those in a separate notebook, or not at all). free_sloshing.ipynb contains scripts to analyse and setup the free sloshing simulations used for paper 2. Anything starting with 'sandbox' is not meant to make sense to anyone but Hossam

- setups: Contains all the idefix setup files for all idefix simulations used for both papers. Hopefully the subdirectories make sense. 


Note: when using the public version of idefix, make sure the solver in the Dust section in any idefix.ini file is set to 'hll_dust' instead of 'hll_dustathena', which does not exist in the public version. I tried to clean all the idefix.ini files in the free_sloshing directory from this but I may have skipped some
